## üöö Shipping Mode Trends
- *Standard Class* consistently dominated.  
- *Same Day* remained the least used across all regions.  

---

## üí° Recommendations

### 1. Double down on high-performing categories (Chairs & Tables)
- Allocate more inventory to Chairs and Tables since they consistently outperform other categories.  
- Develop targeted promotions and bundle offers (e.g., ‚ÄúChair + Table sets‚Äù) to maximize cross-selling opportunities.  
- Ensure supply chain readiness before peak months (Sept‚ÄìDec) to avoid stockouts.  

### 2. Address negative profit months despite high sales
- Conduct cost analysis for regions/months where sales were strong but profits dropped (e.g., Central in Sept 2014, South in Oct 2017).  
- Review discounts, shipping costs, and product return rates that might be cutting into margins.  
- Reevaluate pricing strategies during seasonal peaks.  

### 3. Leverage top-performing cities for growth
- Strengthen distribution and marketing in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle (top sales drivers).  
- Explore micro-targeted campaigns in these cities to increase brand loyalty and repeat purchases.  
- Use them as ‚Äúanchor cities‚Äù to test new campaigns before rolling them out nationwide.  

### 4. Turn around low-performing cities
- Investigate underperforming markets like Henderson, Springfield, and Kenosha.  
- Analyze whether poor sales stem from weak demand, poor marketing, or inefficient delivery logistics.  
- Pilot localized marketing campaigns, partnerships with local distributors, or promotions to improve visibility.  

### 5. Optimize shipping logistics
- Reduce over-reliance on Standard Class (59% usage). Explore offering incentives for Second Class or First Class where delivery cost-to-profit ratio is favorable.  
- Review the cost-effectiveness of Same Day shipping to determine if expanding it could improve customer satisfaction without harming profit.  
- Negotiate better shipping contracts to reduce delivery costs in loss-making months.  

### 6. Prepare for seasonal peaks (Sept‚ÄìDec)
- Increase marketing spend in August to capture early demand before holiday peaks.  
- Optimize staffing and warehousing in Q4 to ensure smooth operations.  
- Run promotions during September (often high-profit months) and ensure December (highest sales month) is supported with cost-efficient supply chain management.
